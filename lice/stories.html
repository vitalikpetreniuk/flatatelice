                    All I wanted to say is thank you so much for helping our family. I was so overwhelmed when all four of my daughters had lice. I was so confused and distressed that I did not know what to do! But help came in the form of Lice Troopers.
                </span>
                    <span class="cont">
                    I called your helpline and talked with Jennie, who talked me through the strategy of how we will together fight and rid this problem. The next day Tina came to our house and you won’t believe how happy I was to see her come to our rescue. She was kind, professional and so good with my daughters. She was able to screen our whole family, even the grandmothers as they are most often taking care of the girls while I am at work. She helped clear all the myths and educated us on the ways of preventing and screening lice so that they never come back again. She taught me how to treat my daughters for lice. The more I listened, the more I learned and when the time came for her to go, I finally overcame being overwhelmed to becoming overjoyed! The money spent on your service is so much less than the money I wasted on prescription shampoos and worthless treatments. Thank you Tina and Lice Troopers for you have given us peace of mind when everything else failed.

                   I wanted to thank you for sending Sharron to my home. I have had this lice problem for so long and had tried treating my kids but I think I always missed some of the lice. But Sharron was the answer to all my lice problems.

                    <span class="cont">
                   She was nice, friendly, educating, calming, and did I mention nice! The information she gave us and the way she encouraged us and calmed us that everything was going to be OK and that we can take control of our lives again is something I will never forget. If I ever have another child, I am naming her Sharron! That is how wonderful she is. My neighbor’s kids also have lice problems and now that they see my kids are finally free of those little pesky lice, they literally begged me to give them your number. I told them how amazing Lice Troopers is and how your lice problems are about to be history!

                   Thank You and another big Thank You for sending Elizabeth to our home at a time we needed help the most. She came last night and it was such a relief to see her at our home, I have to commend your quick service because my kids were driving me insane with their lice problems.

                    <span class="cont">
                    Calling you guys/gals at Lice Troopers is definitely one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life. Not many out there keep their word when it comes to appointments but Elizabeth came at the exact time that was convenient for us all. She was fun and calm and wonderful with the kids. Even though my kids had been wishing and hoping to get rid of lice, they actually wished having lice again just to have Elizabeth in our house again! They loved her so much and I can’t thank you enough for having someone like Elizabeth at your company to help people like us with lice problems. Every parent I meet just can’t stop praising Elizabeth and your company. I am recommending you to every parent with kids to call you if they ever have lice problems. I wish you great success in your business!

                  But, she was friendly, patient and encouraging. She definitely took the sting and stigma out of being infected with lice. Julie was amazing with my daughter too.

Thank you so much for sending someone like Julie to help us out, Julie Rocks!!!

                    For two months my daughter has had lice. No matter what I did, the lice just won’t go away. So, I called up Lice Troopers and the next day we were blessed to have Tina come to our house.

                    <span class="cont">
                     She not only checked my daughter’s hair but also educated her in the ways of combing her hair the right way and also helped us identify nits and lice. It is because of Tina that we are finally lice free!!! And not only that, we have the knowledge to make sure that lice don’t ever come back to haunt us! We really loved Tina and enjoyed meeting her very much.
